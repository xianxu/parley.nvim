# Investigate embedded fold-retirement timeout under native suite load

## Problem

A complete recorded #410 integration suite passed its preferred runtime but failed one suspended-fold retirement case on installed Neovim 0.11.7. A subsequent isolated run of the exact same case and product code passed. The precise hang cause is unproven; this is linked to the #412/#414 native timing-under-load family for investigation, not asserted to share their root cause.
