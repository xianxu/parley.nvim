# Agentic documents: Alt+Return makes any right-pane markdown file a session-sync document (universal-agent-input-interface S1, parley side)

## Problem

Project universal-agent-input-interface (ops `teams/devinfra/projects/universal-agent-input-interface/`, design in
`design.md`, slice S1): today only files with `type: session-sync` get the operator lock, Alt+Return submit and the
red winbar. The operator wants any markdown file opened in Couch's right-pane nvim to become an **agentic document**
at its first Alt+Return.
