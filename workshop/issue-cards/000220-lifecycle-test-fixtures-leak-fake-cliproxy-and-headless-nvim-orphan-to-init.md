# Lifecycle test fixtures leak: fake_cliproxy and headless nvim orphan to init

## Problem

The test suite leaks two kinds of process, both reparented to init (`ppid 1`),
and they accumulate across runs until the machine is unusable.

Measured on the operator's machine, 2026-09-06:

    load average: 584.95, 255.09, 117.45     (1-minute, and RISING)
    1563 total processes

    430 x Python  -> tests/fixtures/fake_cliproxy
    130 x nvim --headless -c set rtp+=... plenary.nvim | runtime plugin/plenary.vim

All dated 2026-09-01, five days before the measurement, so they survive
indefinitely once orphaned. The operator's symptom was visible keyboard lag while
typing and slow copy-paste — in a different repo's application entirely, because
the cost is machine-wide.

Killing them dropped the process count 1563 -> 1091.

**`fake_cliproxy` is a good fixture and that is the point.** Its own docstring
says why it exists — "a real subprocess speaking the `/v1/models` identity
protocol parley probes, so the lifecycle tests exercise spawn / health-probe /
reuse against an actual HTTP server rather than function mocks". That is the
right call. A fixture that models an external service by BEING a process just
has to be reaped like one, and the leak is in the reaping, not in the choice.

**`pgrep -f` cannot see them, which is why a cleanup looks complete when it is
not.** On this macOS:

    pgrep -fc fake_cliproxy        -> 0
    ps -Ao args= | grep -c '[f]ake_cliproxy'  -> 91

So the obvious cleanup command silently no-ops, and 89 orphans survived a
`pkill -f` sweep that appeared to succeed. Any documented remedy has to use `ps`
rather than `pgrep`.
