# Check operator Neovim compatibility

## Problem

The operator's PATH Neovim is 0.11.7, but scripts/test-nvim.sh selects 0.12.5 for its newer LuaJIT mcode fix. Our full suite can therefore pass while the installed operator editor is broken.

During #373's real-profile live check, all full-suite tests passed on 0.12.5, then a registered move failed immediately on PATH Neovim 0.11.7 with E976: Using a Blob as a String. document_move's journal-budget namespace contains a NUL; vim.fn.sha256 accepts its binary representation on 0.12 but refuses it on 0.11. The lease-boundary defect is fixed under #373; this issue owns preventing the wider version-coverage gap.
