# Alt+Shift+O: go back through visited files (per window), up the tree to the root

## Problem

The universal-agent-input-interface project (ops `teams/devinfra/projects/universal-agent-input-interface/`) turns
markdown files into a connected tree: the session file → an answer or side doc → a link inside it → … The operator
navigates down with Alt+o (parley#327) and needs to come back **up the tree, file by file, to the root** (e.g. the
session file). `Ctrl-o` walks every cursor position, so it takes many presses per file; `Ctrl-^` toggles only between
two files; `:bp` follows buffer-list order, not visit order.
