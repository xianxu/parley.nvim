# Open a link with <M-o>, falling back to gf

## Problem

Following a link is the most-used navigation in a forked transcript, and it is
on the hardest key. #214 moved it from `<C-g>o` to `<M-g>` to join the alt
family; the operator, using forks heavily, reports `<M-g>` is awkward to press.

Two things are wrong beyond the reach:

1. **`<M-o>` is the obvious key and is taken.** It opens the skill picker
   (`review_menu`, `scope = markdown`, chosen by the operator in #133 —
   "alt+o = skill selector"). `<M-o>` is therefore free in a chat buffer and
   taken in a markdown one, which is exactly the per-buffer-type divergence
   #214 spent sixteen rounds removing.
2. **Open dead-ends instead of falling through.** With the cursor on anything
   that is not a `🌿:` line, an inline `[🌿:…](file)` or an `@@ref@@`,
   `OpenFileUnderCursor` logs *"No file reference (@@ syntax) found on current
   line"* and stops. Meanwhile `gf` (`resolve_ref_gf`) already does the sensible
   thing for everything else: resolve an ariadne artifact ref, else native `gf`.
   One key should cover "go to the thing under my cursor."
