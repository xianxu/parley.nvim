# Native undo/redo autosave case sees Remote view unavailable

## Problem

`tests/integration/session_sync_native_spec.lua`, case `session-sync native edits undo releases acquisition baseline, redo retakes: open autosave=true`, failed once at :1593. The notice list held 'Remote view unavailable; reopen the file to retry' where the test expected none.
