# side docs S3: on a name change the mover rewrites the parent's links and discussions index, suffixes an orphan .side folder, and passes ariadne's shared move fixtures

## Problem

The S3 design for side docs (ops `teams/devinfra/projects/universal-agent-input-interface/design.side/07-s3-side-docs.md`, final at ops cf0f0ebf, section 6; decisions by the operator, 10-16) needs parley's document mover (parley.nvim#332, `document_move_plan.lua`) to finish what a rename does. Today the mover moves `<name>.side/` with the file, rewrites each side doc's `parent:` and backlinks, and renames Couch's registry entry. A name change (`design.md` → `spec.md`) leaves the parent's own links into `design.side/…` and its `discussions:` index entries pointing at the old folder.
