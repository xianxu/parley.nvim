## sort order of note finder

Right now note finder seems to be sorted on filename. I want to sort order to be based on last accessed time. 

I also use a plugin called frequency, which extends telescope to have a database of frequently accessed files, and sort based on that. Do you think you can leverage frequency plugin of telescope to provide a sort order based on access frequency? 

The filter condition (recent, week, all) stays the same, sort order only apply to files that pass filter condition
