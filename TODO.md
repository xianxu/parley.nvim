# TODO

## ✅ More date filter in Note Finder (Completed)

Right now, note finder have two filter modes, either filter by 3 months (configurable) or no filter on date. I want to change this as follows:

1. ✅ add a "focus" mode, where filter notes in this week. here week as defined as a week starting from Sunday, to next Saturday.
2. ✅ the filter mode should be remembered across sessions, persisted in the state file.
