# Lessons

## 2026-04-09
- Parley test files hardcode `/tmp/parley-*` paths (`dispatcher_spec.lua:7`, `tree_export_spec.lua:22`, etc.). Under Claude Code sandbox, `/tmp` is narrowed to `/tmp/claude` regardless of user `allowWrite` config, so all these tests fail at setup with `Vim:E739: Cannot create directory`. Fix: use `vim.fn.tempname()` or `os.getenv("TMPDIR")` instead of hardcoded `/tmp/` — it's both sandbox-friendly AND more portable. Tracked for future cleanup (not in #81 scope).
- When adding ONLY new files (no modifications to existing code), regression risk in untouched modules is zero. A full `make test` regression gate is belt-and-suspenders, not load-bearing — individual file verification suffices if you can't run the full suite.
- **When adding a new state to code that already has fragile line-offset arithmetic, refactor first — don't stack another branch.** #81 M2 Task 2.7 needed to insert a tool-loop recursion branch into `chat_respond.M.respond`'s imperative line-position chain (`response_line / response_block_lines / progress_line / response_start_line / raw_request_offset`). Each new branch added an `if recursion then +1 else +3` magic-number offset. Three manual test rounds, three distinct offset bugs (progress_line mismatch, stuck-spinner cleanup failure, suspected buffer-state corruption causing an Anthropic "assistant message prefill" rejection on a payload that looked spec-correct). The third bug was the trigger to stop patching and refactor — filed #90 to extract a pure `exchange → lines` + `positions` layer with a single mutation entry point. Rule: when you notice you're adding the Nth `+K vs +M` branch to the same code path, stop and refactor. The cost of one refactor < the cost of N+1 offset patches + the debug sessions between them.
- **Integration tests at the wiring layer catch bugs unit tests cannot.** During #81 M1 Task 1.8 manual verification, `M.get_agent()` was found to return a sanitized agent snapshot without the `tools`/`max_tool_iterations`/`tool_result_max_bytes` fields. Each hop was unit-tested in isolation (`get_agent_info` with a fake agent table that already had `tools`; `prepare_payload` with an explicit `agent_tools` arg) but no test exercised the full chain `M.agents → get_agent → get_agent_info → prepare_payload`. The bug was caught only by inspecting a real query cache JSON after a real user interaction. Rule: for any multi-hop data flow through module boundaries, write at least one test that exercises the FULL chain with the actual modules wired up, not just mocks at each hop. For any field added to an entity (here: `agent.tools`), grep all the read-sides (functions that build derived objects from the entity) and verify each forwards the field.

## 2026-03-07
- No escaped-quote init in Makefile recipes — use newline-producing helpers + `for` loops
- Run new Make targets against real inputs before closing

## 2026-03-08
- Run `make test-changed` after spec doc changes
- Verify provider capabilities against provider's own docs
- Capability rules go in `provider_params.lua`, not transport code
- Write plan in `tasks/todo.md` before non-trivial work
- Run `make lint` after every change; warnings = failures

## 2026-03-09
- Fast-event callbacks: no direct `nvim_*` APIs — use `vim.schedule`
- Progress UI must handle `reasoning_content` not just tool events
- Normalize provider progress events to shared shape (`kind`/`phase`/`message`)
- Propagate raw progress text for display, not just coarse labels
- `git stash` changing behavior = strong causality signal — diff the stash
- Prefer semantic header keys (`system_prompt`) over overloaded ones (`role`)
- Global whitespace trim can eat required terminal newlines — handle post-trim
- When one path is fixed, narrow focus to remaining failures
- Bottom-anchored picker: verify `scrolloff` + buffer line count, not just window height
- Separate initial placement logic from keyboard navigation scrolling

## 2026-03-11
- UI bugs in live-only: add runtime tracing, don't stop at unit tests
- Bottom-anchored pickers: verify visual-row vs logical-index mapping

## 2026-03-13
- ChatFinder move bugs: instrument full lifecycle in live path, not just helpers

## 2026-03-25
- Read the full existing implementation before adding a variant
- Always handle `~/` expansion in file path resolution
- Strip empty-content messages before sending to LLM — Anthropic rejects them
- Sanitize inputs when extracting reusable functions (strip `cache_control`, etc.)
- Programmatic buffer inserts don't fire `BufEnter` — trigger renders manually
- `x or {}` default eats `nil` — use sentinel if nil has meaning
- Cross-file picker nav: use `edit` not `split`, clamp cursor to line count
- After `edit`, use `nvim_get_current_buf()` not stale buffer variable

## 2026-03-28
- Float picker is insert-mode — only `<C-*>` and arrow keys work as actions
- Don't nil-guard broken state — fix the caller instead
- Chat file paths must be relative to containing file, not cwd — use `:t` not `:~:.`
- New keybindings must use config-driven mechanism (`chat_shortcut_*` in config.lua + `M.cmd.*`) — don't copy hardcoded patterns

## 2026-03-29
- Picker tests: don't assert mappings by numeric index (`mappings[2]`) — indices shift when new mappings are added. Look up by key name instead
- `GROUPS` is a bash built-in variable (user's group IDs) — never use it as a custom variable name. Same caution for `RANDOM`, `SECONDS`, `LINENO`, etc.
- `flock` is Linux-only — use `mkdir` for cross-platform locking (atomic on macOS and Linux)
- `claude -p` in background/piped processes needs `< /dev/null` to avoid stdin timeout warnings
- `claude -p` without `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` may silently fail when tools need approval but no TTY is available
- Parallel agents sharing a git working directory: don't use `git status` diff to detect changes from one agent — other concurrent agents may have modified files too
- `timeout` is GNU coreutils — not on macOS. Use `perl -e 'alarm shift; exec @ARGV'` as portable fallback
- `wait -n` requires bash 4.3+ — macOS ships bash 3.2. Use `kill -0` polling instead
- When a subprocess fails silently and its empty stdout is treated as "success", the feature appears to work but does nothing — always check exit codes or validate output isn't vacuous

## 2026-04-06
- Don't use `git stash` mid-task to "verify lint baseline." Pre-existing stashes in the sandbox can collide with the pop and corrupt unrelated files (Makefile got merge markers, broke `make`). To check whether warnings/errors are pre-existing, run lint on a clean clone in /tmp or just compare the warning *count* against `git show HEAD:<file>` — never disturb the working tree.
