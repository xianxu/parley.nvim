# Drill-In Markers

Inline drill-in lets a user select text inside a chat transcript, wrap it as a marker `🤖<T>[Q]`, and have it resolved into a quote-and-question block prepended to the next user turn on the next chat-respond cycle.

The marker syntax is the same one the [review skill](../modes/review.md) uses on non-chat markdown. The parser is shared (`lua/parley/skills/review/init.lua` → `_parse_marker_sections`). Drill-in is the chat-buffer–side downstream of that syntax.

## Marker shape

```
🤖<T>[Q]            — drill-in: human picks T from earlier text, types Q
🤖<T>[Q]{A}[Q2]…    — discussion chain about T (alternating)
🤖[Q]               — bare human turn, no quoted body
🤖[Q1]{A1}[Q2]…     — chain without a quoted body
🤖{A}               — agent annotation, no quoted body, no human turn
🤖~D~               — proposed deletion of D
🤖~D~{N}            — proposed replacement of D with N (agent-authored)
🤖~D~[N]            — proposed replacement of D with N (human-authored)
```

- **Has quoted body** = `<T>` is present (the first slot, immediately after 🤖). Optional and at most one. Drill-in's resolve-chain command only touches markers with `<T>`.
- **Has strike** = `~D~` is present (same slot as `<T>` — mutually exclusive). Strike markers are *proposals* (deletion or replacement), not questions to the agent.
- **Ready** = last section is a non-empty `[]` (matches the review-skill ready definition). Markers ending in `{}` are *pending* and stay inline as agent annotations. Strike markers are *never* ready (even with trailing `[]`, since they're proposals not questions).

The chat-respond pipeline gathers every ready marker (with or without `<T>`) — the difference is in how the marker collapses inline (see Lifecycle step 3). Strike markers are skipped entirely.

See [#123](../../workshop/issues/000123-quoted-body-marker-syntax.md) for the rationale behind `<T>`. See [#124](../../workshop/issues/000124-review-convention-alignment.md) and the canonical [review-convention target](../../../ariadne/workshop/targets/review-convention.md) for the strike family and the broader convention parley.nvim implements.

Accept and reject for `~X~` and the full §5 table are wired via `<M-a>` / `<M-r>` (#124 M2 — see the keybinding table below).

## Lifecycle

1. **Create** — visual-mode `<C-g>q` (or `<M-q>`) wraps the selection as `🤖<T>[]` and drops the cursor inside the empty `[]` in insert mode.
2. **Compose** — user types the question (multi-line allowed).
3. **Submit** — `<C-g>g` (chat respond) processes ready markers. Two paths:

   - **Branch path** (cursor on a past exchange that contains ready markers): treats them as follow-up questions for that exchange. Strips them in place inside the exchange and **inserts a new user turn after that exchange's answer**, populated with the gathered quote+question blocks. The original Q/A is preserved (no resubmit). Pipeline `end_index` is capped at the inserted new turn, so subsequent (now stale) exchanges below stay in the buffer but are out of context for this turn.
   - **End-append path** (cursor on the unanswered last question or at end of buffer): gathers every ready marker buffer-wide and appends the gathered blocks to the next user turn slot at the end. Markers are stripped in place. If the user already typed text in the next turn, exactly one blank line separates the user's text from the first block. Multiple blocks are stacked with one blank line between them.

   Inline collapse rule for stripped markers:
   - Marker with `<T>` body → inline replaced by plain `T`.
   - Marker without `<T>` body → marker removed entirely (whitespace not
     normalized). Its block quote is **inferred** from the surrounding reply
     prose (#127) so the flattened comment keeps an anchor — see Anchor
     inference below.
   - **Referenced-span brackets** (#127, `config.mark_reference_span`, default
     on): the referenced span is enclosed in `[]` *in place* so the reader can
     see what each gathered comment points at — `T` → `[T]`; an inferred span is
     bracketed where it already sits (the snippet is **not** re-inserted). The
     enclosed spans are highlighted `ParleyReference` (see Anchor inference).

4. **Resolve** — `<M-a>` accepts the marker at cursor and `<M-r>` rejects it, per the §5 table. Bulk-resolve was dropped in #124 M2 — operators resolve markers one at a time, or ask an agent to walk the chains (agentic resolution, §6 of the canonical target).

## Resubmit interaction

Cursor on a past exchange (Q has an answer, or cursor on an answer) is normally a *resubmit* — old answer deleted and re-generated. Drill-in detection runs **before** resubmit handling: if the cursor's exchange contains ready markers, the branch path takes over and the resubmit path is skipped. The original answer is preserved.

If `params.range == 2` (explicit range), drill-in handling is skipped entirely; range request takes precedence.

## Quote block format

The quoted body is wrapped in `[…]` (opening `[` on the first quoted line,
closing `]` on the last) and separated from the question by a blank line (#141).
The brackets mirror the `[T]` reference bracket #127 leaves at the source
location, so `*`/`#` on either jumps to the other (see Keybindings).

For a marker `🤖<T>[Q]`:

```
> [T-line-1
> T-line-2]

Q-line-1
Q-line-2
```

For a chain `🤖<T>[U1]{A1}[U2]`:

```
> [T-line-1]
> User: U1
> Agent: A1

U2
```

Continuation lines inside chain sections (multi-line `U1`/`A1`) stay inside the blockquote with `> ` (no per-line `User:`/`Agent:` prefix).

For a no-quote marker `🤖[Q]`, an anchor `Q̂` is inferred from surrounding prose
(#127) and emitted as the bracketed `> [Q̂]` line above `Q`. When no anchor can be
recovered (degradation cases below), only `Q` is emitted (the pre-#127 behavior).
Same for a no-quote chain `🤖[U1]{A1}[U2]` — an inferred `> [Q̂]` line, else none.
Between adjacent gathered blocks, one blank line.

## Anchor inference (#127)

An unquoted marker carries no anchor, so flattening it into the next turn would
strip the comment of *what it's about*. `drill_in.generate_snippet` recovers a
**verbatim anchor** from the reply prose around the marker — so an unquoted
comment is treated as a quoted comment whose `<T>` we infer, routing through the
same block pipeline. It is a *meaning* anchor (the text the model re-reads),
deliberately not a position token; a reference-token scheme was considered and
rejected (see #127 Spec — refs cost a counter + conceal + edit-sync for only
look-alike disambiguation).

Rules (pure function of text + the marker's byte span + optional turn
boundaries):

- **inline** (prose precedes the marker, or a bare marker sits mid-paragraph
  with no blank separation): the preceding ~10–20 words ending at the marker,
  snapped back to a sentence boundary (extends across boundaries if the current
  sentence is <10 words; caps at 20 with a leading `…`).
- **standalone** (the marker is its own blank-separated paragraph): the first
  sentence of the previous prose block (capped ~20 words).
- **degrades to empty** (→ no `>` line) when nothing is recoverable: inline with
  no preceding prose, or standalone at a turn start.

**Turn boundaries.** The backward scan must never cross out of the marker's own
agent turn — otherwise a standalone marker at a reply's start would anchor the
agent's comment to the `💬:` user question or a `🧠:`/`📎:` block. The scan stops
at any line beginning with a configured turn prefix. To keep `generate_snippet`
pure, the prefixes are passed in as `opts.boundaries`; `chat_respond` assembles
them from config (`💬: 🤖: 🧠: 📝: 🔧: 📎: 🌿:`, plus `chat_local_prefix` when
set) and threads them through `gather_and_strip`. Note `---` is a *body* section
separator, **not** a turn boundary, so it never stops the scan.

**Referenced-span brackets + highlight.** `generate_snippet` also returns the
**byte range** of the prose it drew from. With `opts.bracket` (set by
`chat_respond` from `config.mark_reference_span`, default on) `gather_and_strip`
encloses that span in `[]` in place — inline spans absorb the trailing gap +
marker into the closing `]`; standalone spans are bracketed in the previous
paragraph with the marker removed separately. Explicit `<Q>` becomes `[Q]`. The
snippet itself is **never re-inserted** (it's already in the reply — we only
delimit it). The highlighter colors these spans `ParleyReference` (default
underline; `config.highlight.reference` overrides) via a per-line matcher that
skips markdown links `](`, checkboxes, footnote refs, and 1-char content — a
*heuristic*, since plain `[]` can't be told apart from incidental brackets with
certainty. Set `config.mark_reference_span = false` to strip markers without the
brackets. This is the one persistent visual cue for "what this comment points
at" — `ParleyReviewQuoted` (reverse+bold on `🤖<…>`) only marks the scope while
the *live* marker exists; the brackets survive the flatten + file reload.

A small-LLM summarizer fallback (for long/messy spans) is deferred (YAGNI): a
verbatim quote is a strictly better meaning-anchor than a paraphrase, and the
fallback would live behind the same `generate_snippet` seam if ever needed.

## Cross-tool consistency

Both parley and ariadne (`/fix` skill) parse this marker family identically. The on-disk shape is the canonical interchange format — there is no separate "drill-in" syntax.

## Key files

- `lua/parley/drill_in.lua` — pure-function module (`parse`, `gather_and_strip`, `generate_snippet`, `resolve`, `accept_at`, `reject_at`, `format_block`, `format_blocks`, `wrap`, `append_blocks`, `bracket_at`).
- `lua/parley/chat_respond.lua` — pre-processing hook before message build (gates on resubmit detection); assembles the turn-prefix `boundaries` from config and threads them into `gather_and_strip` (#127).
- `lua/parley/init.lua` — `<M-q>` (insert), `<M-a>` (accept), `<M-r>` (reject) wiring inside `prep_chat` / `setup_markdown_keymaps`; and the chat-only `*`/`#`/`g*`/`g#` anchor-jump maps (`bracket_jump`, #141) set in `prep_chat`.
- `lua/parley/skills/review/init.lua` — shared section parser (`_parse_marker_sections`).
- `lua/parley/buffer_edit.lua` — `replace_all_lines` helper used to write the rewritten buffer in one shot.
- `tests/unit/drill_in_spec.lua` — unit specs for the pure module.
- `tests/integration/chat_respond_spec.lua` — integration specs for the chat-respond hook.

## Keybindings (parley_buffer scope, buffer-local)

The marker keymaps are wired into the shared `parley_buffer` scope so
they work in both chat buffers and plain markdown buffers (notes, issues,
parley files outside configured chat roots — anywhere `prep_md` runs).
Register-side: `M.prep_chat` and `M.setup_markdown_keymaps` both pass the
same `drill_in_callbacks(buf)` table to `register_buffer`.

| Binding              | Mode | Action                                               |
|----------------------|------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `<C-g>q` / `<M-q>`   | v/x  | Wrap selection as `🤖<T>[]`, cursor inside `[]` |
| `<C-g>q` / `<M-q>`   | i, n | Insert bare `🤖[]` at cursor, cursor inside `[]` |
| `<M-a>`              | n    | Accept the marker at cursor per review-convention §5 |
| `<M-r>`              | n    | Reject the marker at cursor per review-convention §5 |

**Anchor jump (chat buffers only, #141).** `*`/`#`/`g*`/`g#` with the cursor
inside any `[…]` search the whole bracketed string (literal `\V[…]`) instead of
the word under the cursor — so a `[quoted text]` anchor jumps to its twin (the
`[T]` reference #127 leaves at the source). Outside any bracket they fall through
to the builtin motion via `normal!`. Wired directly in `prep_chat`
(chat-buffer-local), not through the registry, so they don't apply in plain
markdown buffers.

Known boundaries (single-line by design): `bracket_at` reads only the cursor
line, so a `[…]` spanning multiple lines (a multi-line quote rendered `> [line1`
… `> lineN]`) is not recognized and falls through to the builtin motion. A
truncated inferred anchor (`generate_snippet` ellipsis) won't string-match its
source span, so `*` finds no twin there. Both are acceptable for the common
single-line `[quoted text]` ↔ `[T]` twin case this targets.

Accept/reject semantics (the full table) live in the canonical [review-convention target](../../../ariadne/workshop/targets/review-convention.md) §5. In summary:

- `<X>` anchor → X preserved (both modes)
- `~D~` anchor → accept removes D (or splices in the first `{N}`/`[N]` after the strike); reject restores D
- Bare `🤖{R}` → accept splices R; reject removes the marker
- Everything else with no anchor (pure commentary chains) → empty (both modes)
